# p1mon-django
p1monitor with python-django backend

A p1 monitor project to read Dutch smart meters (electricity and gas) through the P1 USB connection.

This project was forked from the p1mon project at https://www.ztatz.nl/ .
The project design was appreciated and therefore retained.
The front-end was borrowed with minor edits.
The PHP back-end was replaced with a python django backend.
Calculations were replaced with data table operations using pandas.
